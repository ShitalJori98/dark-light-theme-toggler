             "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general.
            The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science.
            "In nature, nothing is perfect and everything is perfect. Trees can be contorted, 
            bent in weird ways, and they're still beautiful". Those who contemplate the beauty of the earth 
            find reserves of strength that will endure as long as life lasts.... This is the law of nature."</p>
